            <b>In this game you try to maneuver through a maze as a cat and collect bananas to win.<br>
            This game was inspired by the scary maze game, we wanted to create a game similar to it.</b><br>
            <br>
            1. I learned that defining blocks made the code less messy, so I defined some in the Scratch game to make things less confusing and compress some of the coding.<br>
            2. We had many problems with forever loops that had to do with color so we used repeat until loops and changed the colors of the background and text.<br>
            3. I like how our game makes the user move the character with the movement of the mouse instead of arrow keys, making it more challenging.<br>
            4. If we had more time on the game, would make more unique stages and add more scary sprites and sounds to those stages.<br>
